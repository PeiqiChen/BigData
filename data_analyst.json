Founded in 1933 at the request of Albert Einstein, the IRC offers lifesaving care and life-changing assistance to refugees, IDPs, and others affected by war or disaster. At work today in over 40 countries and in 22 U.S. cities, the IRC restores safety, dignity and hope to millions who are uprooted and struggling to endure. We address both the immediate, life -saving needs of conflict-affected people in an emergency and the reconstruction needs in post-conflict societies.\n\nThe Airbel Impact Lab, IRC’s hub for research and innovation, supports the various technical units across the IRC to conduct or backstop research studies and innovation projects, and also leads initiatives that provide resources for country programs to design and implement programs based on evidence. We conduct this research across IRC’s outcome areas of health, economic wellbeing, safety, power, and education.\n\nFor this project, the Airbel Impact Lab (Research & Innovation at the International Rescue Committee - IRC) and Violence Prevention and Response Technical Unit is looking for a consultant to conduct analysis of a cluster randomized controlled trial. This trial evaluates the effectiveness of the Safe at Home program on changes in family functioning, child abuse, and intimate partner violence. Secondary analyses goals are to understand the pathways through which potential changes have occurred. Analyses would be conducted for both intent-to-treat and per protocol approaches across ~200 couples, in which data are available for both men’s and women’s reports.\n• *Scope of Work:**\n\nThe consultant will be expected to:\n\n\\- Refine multilevel regression analyses to understand both intent-to-treat and per protocol changes over time on outcomes of interest, accounting for clustering at the group and site level. For violence outcomes in particular, examine changes in cessation and frequency/severity over time.\n\\- Examine impacts for heterogeneity of treatment effect by baseline demographics or other variables in sensitivity analyses\n\\- Undertake latent class analyses to examine patterns of violence within families and potential change over time\n\\- Explore dyadic analyses of change over time within couples\n• *Deliverables:**\n\n\\- Tables for use in reports and peer-reviewed manuscripts, including the above outlined analyses and results\n\\- All coding logs and outputs\n• *Qualifications**\n• *Payment Rate and Schedule:**\n\n\\- 30% after delivery of cleaned dataset and descriptive statistics\n\\- 70% at the end of the contract\n• *Requirements:**\n\n\\- Highly proficient with demonstrated experience in analyzing trial or longitudinal clustered data\n\\- Expertise in violence prevention research, and in particular, familiarity with constructs and standard coding of outcomes\n\\- Attention to detail\n\\- Postdoctoral level preferred, but doctoral level statistical training possible based on years of experience",

      "job_description": "ProsperOK Background: Incarceration and economic hardship does not only affect people behind bars and those close to them. It has a statewide ripple effect in limiting our communities’ potential, widening racial and economic disparities, and perpetuating intergenerational cycles of poverty. Building a more equitable and prosperous Oklahoma requires transformative changes in the way we collectively design and implement policies and practices, make decisions, and think and speak about crime and safety.\n\nIn 2021, The Justice and Mobility Fund partnered with the George Kaiser Family Foundation (GKFF) to launch ProsperOK. ProsperOK accelerates economic mobility, reduces incarceration, and bolsters community safety by uplifting people and removing barriers in the criminal legal system. ProsperOK envisions an Oklahoma that cares more than it confines; prevents and rehabilitates more than it punishes; and empowers communities to pursue solutions that increase economic opportunity and transform power systems. ProsperOK is supporting a new initiative in Tulsa called JusticeLink.\n\nJusticeLink: The nearly 16,000 Tulsans released from jail each year face critical barriers to accessing care, housing, work, and other services essential to getting back on their feet. Re-arrest and recidivism are common, as nearly 40% of all Tulsa County jail admissions represent people arrested multiple times in the year. Coordination and navigation challenges in Tulsa contribute to this problem as there are currently no standards for coordination between agencies and nonprofits.\n\nLaunched in October 2022, JusticeLink is a new diversion services center established in Tulsa that acts as a collaborative, multi-agency network dedicated to providing coordinated, life-stabilizing services to justice-involved people navigating the criminal legal system.\n\nKey features of JusticeLink include:\n• One-stop-shop under one roof for clients to access multiple service providers around employment, case management, education, housing, family services, mental health, substance abuse and public benefits\n• Personalized justice navigation for issues around fines & fees, court appearances and legal support, among other needs\n• Service referrals to other high-quality providers\n\nPosition Summary:\n\nThe Data Analyst will be responsible for maintaining JusticeLink’s data systems and technology, data analysis and reporting to determine program outcomes, influence program improvements, and ensure effective utilization of data and information with staff, key stakeholders, and funders.\n\nPrinciple Duties/Responsibilities:\n\nThe following functions represent the majority of the duties performed by the position. The description is not meant to be all-inclusive or prevent other duties from being assigned when necessary:\n• Work closely with Program Director, JusticeLink staff, and participating partners to record and manage client data within JusticeLink’s case management system (Salesforce) and closed-loop referral system for internal operations and external reporting/coordination functions.\n• Work closely with Program Director to understand and maintain focus on their analytical needs, including identifying critical metrics and KPIs, and deliver actionable insights to relevant decision-makers.\n• Proactively analyze data to answer key questions from stakeholders or out of self-initiated curiosity with an eye for what drives business performance, investigating and communicating areas for improvement in efficiency and productivity.\n• Create and maintain rich interactive visualizations through data interpretation and analysis integrating various reporting components from multiple data sources.\n• Define and implement data acquisition and integration logic, selecting appropriate combination of methods and tools within defined technology stack to ensure optimal scalability and performance of the solution.\n• Develop and maintain databases by acquiring data from primary and secondary sources, and build scripts that will make our data evaluation process more flexible or scalable across data sets.\n• Effectively communicate complex, data-oriented information intelligibly to stakeholder’s and partners who are not specialized in data analysis.\n\nQUALIFICATIONS/SPECIFICATIONS:\n\nEducation & Experience:\n• High school diploma is required. Bachelor’s degree in management information systems, data analytics, mathematics, computer science, or statistics strongly preferred.\n• Minimum 3+ years experience in data management analysis.\n• Previous experience with criminal-legal system impacted clients and/or engaging culturally diverse populations in social services is preferred. Lived experience navigating criminal justice systems also qualifies and is highly valued in this role.\n\nSkills and Knowledge:\n• Proven analytical skills, including mining, evaluation, analysis, and visualization.\n• Highly organized and detail oriented, ensuring excellence in data integrity,\n• Demonstrated competency in interpreting and translating raw data into business insights, narratives, and reports that inform program development & influence strategy to achieve program outcomes.\n• Technical writing experience in relevant areas, including queries, reports, and presentations.\n• Excellent interpersonal communication skills in order to communicate effectively with peers and to maintain productive working relationships with diverse stakeholders and agency partners.\n• Ability to proactively plan and execute projects, consistently meeting deadlines and results.\n• Professional courtesy and empathy towards the diverse situation and needs of individuals in the criminal legal system.\n\nSalary:\n• The expected range for the stating salary for this position will be between $52,000 - $55,000 per year. Salary offering will ultimately depend on prior experience, education, and other qualifications.\n\nHours & Location:\n• Position is based in the JusticeLink office located at 211 West Archer, Tulsa, OK.\n• Typical work hours are Monday – Friday from 8:00 to 5:00, but flexibility required for various JusticeLink events or meetings that may occur evenings or weekends.",

CrowdStrike participates in the E-Verify program. Notice of E-Verify Participation Right to Work CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 to fix a fundamental problem: The sophisticated attacks that were forcing the world’s leading businesses into the headlines could not be solved with existing malware-based defenses. Founder George Kurtz realized that a brand new approach was needed — one that combines the most advanced endpoint protection with expert intelligence to pinpoint the adversaries perpetrating the attacks, not just the malware. There’s much more to the story of how Falcon has redefined endpoint protection but there’s only one thing to remember about CrowdStrike: We stop breaches.",

      "job_description": "We a transitioning from our long term consultants we have used for 5 years for an annual excel survey analysis + modeling task. The consultants have become too busy because of their own internally developed tech new business opportunity to handle our limited off consulting task anymore.\n\nThe job we execute annually takes place late March into early April, and, and involves getting all our report finished by mid-April at the latest. As our deadline is dictated by external parties to which we must submit information, it is critical that the analyst be willing and able to set aside time to do the work as on time as agreed. Delays and postponements are not tenable for any reason and will lead to immediate termination of the work.\n\nThe work involves two major aspects:\n\n(a)Analyzing survey data in excel to determine the numbers of different model types of Pay TV set-top boxes (i.e. the boxes used to access Comcast, Dish, Verizon etc on your TV) that surveyed consumers have in their homes in certain zip codes in the United States. This task also involves facilitating and corralling some of the surveys (SurveyMonkey is used as the main tool, but also email submittals etc. are allowed to cure bad responses), reviewing submittals for validity, accepting and rejecting submittals. This involves survey participants sending picture proofs that they have certain model Pay TV set-top boxes installed in their homes, and the analyst responsible for confirming this. The survey participants are paid by us or our vendors for their role. Other, trusted surveys are provided to us directly from trusted databases by third parties already completed in excel and no quality review is required.\n\n(b) Using these data from both survey streams, update annual excel models that estimate how much energy efficiency savings these Pay TV set-top boxes are, in aggregate generating annually compared to certain benchmarks, based on the survey samples.\n\nThe aspect (a) above is the more variable and time consuming aspect of the work as it requires coordination and some back and forth with survey participants who may not get things right initially. Aspect (b) is a breeze of just spreadsheet and computer logic.\n\nAs a gauge of the volume of the work, the main analyst billed roughly 80 hours last year. This is not the exact volume this year will be, it is to be treated as useful information only. On one hand we have just simplified the main models for this year with the help our the current team, so less hours will be billed on those. On the other hand, there will be learning curves for any new analyst, and we are likely to add add new work of a related but not the exact same item models previously done which will be completely handled by the new analyst, and will constitute entirely new work.\n\nThe analyst should be highly proficient in excel modeling and logic, and analysts have also used python to automate somethings. For the right party with the right analysis and modeling skillsets this will be a straightforward task once the logic and approach explained and understood. Because we don’t want to be switching analysts annually due to stability and confidentiality reasons, we will also want to see evidence that this person or entity can support us for several years going forward on similar basis at approximately the same time of the year.",
