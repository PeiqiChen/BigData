Display a willingness to play the role needed for project success\n\n● Collaborate with other senior team members to help grow the capabilities of our development team and to grow what our office can contribute to the company\n\nQualifications\n\nRequirements:\n\n● 5+ years’ experience with a modern language such as Java, C#, etc\n\n● 5+ years’ experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP\n\n● Strong understanding of object-oriented development\n\n● Strong understanding of relational database models and proficient with SQL\n\n● Experience that helps you tell simple trade-offs from hard problems\n\n● Ability to think strategically and tactically to solve problems in a fast-paced and often changing environment\n\n● Understanding of Agile, Scrum or other iterative development methodologies\n\n● Ability and desire to learn new technologies and development tools quickly\n\n● Experience with using modern IDEs (Eclipse, Sublime) and SCM tools (SVN, Git)\n\n● A creative mindset to apply innovative approaches to software design\n\n● Desire to work in a highly collaborative environment with a large team of like-minded developers\n\n● Salesforce.com APEX and Visualforce experience desired but not required\n\n● Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or a related major\n\n● Willingness to travel up to 10%\n\n● Authorized to work for any U.S. employer\n\nAdditional Information\n\nBenefits:\n\nAcumen Solutions offers the opportunity for growth and advancement, as well as a competitive base salary, annual performance based incentives, medical benefits, and 401k.\n\nAbout Us:\n\nAs a leading management and technology consulting firm, Acumen Solutions offers a range of challenging and rewarding opportunities whether you’re just starting out in your career, looking to advance your career, or seeking a senior leadership position.
