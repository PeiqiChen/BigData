      "job_description": "Overview\n\nProtecting U.S. residents and visitors is among our nation’s highest priorities. As adversaries gain access to sophisticated technologies and materials, the threats grow more dynamic and complex—from cyber and nuclear to chemical and biological weapons of mass effect and other forms of terrorism. The PNNL national security mission employs our researchers, tools, and technologies to play a key role in advancing the ability to identify and secure nuclear materials, detect weapons of mass effect, manage nonproliferation treaties, secure our nation's borders, and protect critical infrastructures. PNNL’s scientific discovery and capabilities—rooted in innovative theory, methods, algorithms, and tools—are enabling stronger, more resilient technologies and systems to safeguard national security. Coupled with decades of radiological and nuclear materials expertise, advanced computing and threat analysis capabilities, and a broad fundamental science base, we are identifying and countering emerging threats that have significant impact at home and around the globe.\n\nThe Math, Stats, and Data Science (MSDS) Group within the National Security Directorate is looking for an early-career scientist with a background in mathematics, statistics, data science, and domain science to contribute to interdisciplinary projects in environment, materials science, energy, and national security.\n\nData scientists in the MSDS group use mathematics, statistics, and data analysis techniques to develop high quality and defensible methods and tools to address critical scientific challenges in national security, energy, environment, materials sciences, and fundamental sciences. In many cases, our research is deployed across a variety of compute architectures to support big data analytics problems. Examples of our capability areas include:\n• Mathematics and Statistics: We rely on deep technical expertise in classical mathematics, statistics, and computational modeling to identify, develop, and defend algorithmic solutions to challenging scientific problems. This spans a wide variety of disciplines including experimental design, optimization, uncertainty quantification, signal processing, functional analysis, modeling, artificial intelligence, machine/deep learning, game theory, graph theory, and Bayesian modeling. We also have deep expertise in bringing the areas of topology, algebra, and geometry to bear on data science problems. Recognizing that no one tool or model can provide the whole solution, we work together to produce innovative solutions that go beyond what we can do ourselves.\n• Domain Science Driven Solutions: We pride ourselves on choosing the right solution for the problem at hand. This is only possible through close partnerships with domain science experts including biologists, chemists, computer vision experts, geospatial analysts, nuclear chemists and engineers, material scientists, environmental scientists, and natural language processors. Our team understands that domain-specific characteristics should steer solutions—we guide experimental design and study planning, data collection, developing methods and executing analyses, reporting results and providing recommendations, and establishing data archival procedures. Our integral role in developing and executing study lifecycles results in explainable, reproducible, and validated research across the entire breadth of laboratory research including problems in critical-infrastructure analysis, classification of multi-omic functionality, environmental planning, nuclear safety, and national security.\n• Uncertainty, Risk, and Tradeoffs Analysis: We develop and deploy operational decision-making tools in several domains using model-based and data-driven learning. In doing so, we characterize operations, risk, resilience, and deterrence; incorporate adversarial behavior; and optimize solutions under limited resource constraints. We consider real-world uncertainties around supply chains and concepts of operations, imperfect measurements and observations, human intervention, and external impacts. In the face of these challenges, we provide strategic options and alternatives, quantify confidence in our recommendations to manage risks, and provide effective and achievable solutions that support operational objectives.\n• Deployment to Users: At our core, we are applied researchers and provide results and tools to stakeholders including data scientists, subject matter experts, decision, and policy makers. We serve diverse communities and work to communicate effectively by facilitating educational courses, producing high quality papers for peer reviewed publication, and creating user-friendly software tools that can be deployed in a variety of environments.\n\nData science researchers and practitioners work side by side to apply advanced theories, methods, algorithms, models, evaluation tools and testbeds, and computational-based solutions to address complex scientific challenges affecting a wide range of domains and application areas.

The school encompasses 23 departments and 25 interdisciplinary programs. H&S is home to fundamental and applied research, where free, open, and critical inquiry is pursued across disciplines. As the university's largest school, H&S serves as the foundation of a Stanford undergraduate education no matter which discipline students pursue as a major. Graduate students work alongside world-renowned faculty to pursue and shape foundational research that leads to breakthroughs and discoveries that shed new light on the past, influence the present, and shape the future. Together, faculty and students in H&S engage in inspirational teaching, learning, and research every day.\n\nThe Immigration Policy Lab (IPL) at Stanford University evaluates and designs policies surrounding the integration of immigrants and refugees worldwide. By producing new evidence and translating it into creative solutions, we seek to improve migrants' lives and strengthen their host communities. Using large datasets, creative research designs, and cutting-edge analytical tools, we bring new evidence to bear on the urgent problems facing immigrant and refugee service providers. We engage with community-based organizations as well as local, state, national, and international governmental agencies to test the effectiveness of current policies and design new policies, programs, and tools that ultimately impact millions of migrants, as well as the economic and social prosperity of the countries in which they live. Our talented team of faculty, staff, postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students is creating an innovative research model that combines the quality and rigor of an academic lab with the efficiency and innovation of a civic-tech startup.\n\nThe Data Scientist will provide analytical expertise to the Immigrant Health research program and other IPL projects as needed. Working closely with the Faculty Co-Directors, Program Manager, and other program staff, the Data Scientist will be responsible for organizing, creating, managing, and updating datasets, assuring data and analysis meet rigorous replication standards, and exploring new and creative data collection and analytical methods. The Data Scientist will work closely with faculty and staff to develop research designs, conduct and interpret analysis (including replications), implement algorithms, and oversee the work of postdocs and graduate students. We are looking for candidates who have the ability, experience, and enthusiasm to be the data and statistical leader for research projects focused on developing algorithms and employing experimental and quasi-experimental methods, while lending support to other lab projects as needed.\n\nIPL is a highly collaborative environment. The Data Scientist will have the opportunity to co-author papers envisioned to appear in top journals that report on the results of the studies, as well as work with an array of affiliated faculty from top institutions. Examples of previous studies produced by the lab include projects on the intergenerational impact of DACA on the mental health of children (Science), and improving refugee integration through data-driven algorithmic assignment (Science).\n\nThis is a 100% FTE, 1 year fixed term exempt position.
